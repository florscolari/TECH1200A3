--- In case I panic and forget how to do the version control ---

Take a deep breath...

Stay calm
Use development branch
Commit
Click on main > Checkout to jump to main
A.
Click on development > merge 'development' into 'main'
or
B.
Use main menu Git > merge
Select development to merge on main

Push from local main to remote main on GitHub

Take a deep breath again...
Keep going
